# A great merchant on React and Typescript for your projects

I hope this script will help you, if you have any problems - create an issue

## How to use

1) Download the project
2) Edit web for yourself
3) `npm start` for test or `npm run build` for production
4) upload the  files from build/ to hosting
5) Done ^_^


### How it looks

### Unpleasant features

1) now supports only 6 banks for pretty card preview (sberbank, tinkoff, alfabank, russian standart bank, sovkonbank, gazprombank)
2) only desktop adaptive
3) bank preview can loads too long(bad bin checker api)

*I'll fix it soon
